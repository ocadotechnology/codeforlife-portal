        <h5 id="commitment">1. Our commitment</h5>
        <p>We are deeply committed to creating a safe and secure online learning environment for all students, teachers,
            parents and guardians who use the Code for Life portal.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>We strive to give you control over the personal information that you give us, and we take the protection
                of your information very seriously.</p></li>
            <li><p>We take extra precautions for the safety and privacy of our younger learners. Where personal information
                could be entered, for example when a student names a level, the teacher is notified via email and the
                teacher has the ability to delete the level if its name is rude or compromising.</p></li>
            <li><p>Our portal only relates to Code for Life and we do not show advertisements on our website or within our
                lessons.</p></li>

        <h5 id="information-use">4. How we will use information about you</h5>
        <p>We need all the categories of information that we describe above, so that we can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>perform our agreement with you and provide you with our services. For example, to enable you to create an
                account and to access the portal and our learning materials. Having an account gives teachers access to
                course material, class and individual student management features, and also it gives students access to the
                portal in order to learn how to code within a supported environment (classroom), or independently (at home).</p></li>
            <li>fulfil our legitimate interests, such as our interests to:
                <ul>
                    <li><p>improve our services.</p></li>
                    <li><p>ensure that our portal is secure and is used in accordance with our Terms. For example, we may
                        use account information to limit a user temporarily or permanently from the Code for Life portal if
                        that user engages in inappropriate use of the site (e.g. giving other people access to their user
                        account, malicious misuse of the portal, including spam).</p></li>
                    <li><p>send you important information: for example, we use your email address to send you account
                        verification emails, emails to notify you about changes to our Terms, or about any maintenance
                        impacting your access to the portal. Sometimes, we may be required by law to send you this
                        information.</p></li>
                    <li><p>provide customer support and respond to your queries, for example, when you use the Contact Us
                        form. We strongly advise you not to disclose personal information (other than name and email
                        address) when contacting us – messages you exchange on the portal and any forms you submit to us
                        will be recorded. The Contact Us form is strictly for the purpose of user support. User-initiated
                        communication concerning topics other than those relating directly to the Code for Life portal,
                        including resources or user experience, may not be answered. Please be aware that we will never ask
                        for personal information other than what is required to identify your account and respond to your
                        queries, and we will never ask for your password.</p></li>
                    <li><p>protect our legal rights, for example, if we need to defend ourselves in court.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><p>with your permission (or if you are under 13, the permission of the person who looks after you) to send
                you marketing communications (for example, our newsletter or communications about our portal features or
                upcoming events). You have the right to change your mind at any time (see the “Your Rights” section below
                for more information).</p></li>

                cookies to collect information about how you use our portal, in order to analyse and improve user

        <h6 id="third-party-cookies">6.3 Third party cookies</h6>
        <p>We do not allow third party advertising, or affiliation on our portal.</p>
        <p>As we explain above, we work with other companies to use analytics cookies on our portal: these are Google, who
            provide Google Analytics cookies, and Mouseflow. We explain in more detail below what information they collect
            and how it is used.</p>
        <p><strong>Google Analytics</strong>. Our portal uses Google Analytics, which is provided by Google, Inc.
            ("Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyse how users use our portal. The information generated
            by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by
            Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use
            of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services
            relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties
            where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google
            will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. By accepting analytics / performance
            cookies on our portal, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the
            purposes set out above.</p>
        <p><strong>Mouseflow</strong>. We also use Mouseflow on our portal; this provider offers a website analytics tool
            that helps us understand how our portal is used, and which areas are mostly used (e.g. by using heatmaps or by
            replaying your journey on our portal). Mouseflow uses cookies to record information such as when you click on or
            move your mouse, when you scroll, or press a key, what pages you visit on our website, how much time you spend
            on each page, and also information about the device you use (operating system, device type
            (desktop/tablet/phone), screen resolution, location (city/country), language, and similar metadata). Mouseflow
            does not collect any information on pages where it is not installed, nor does it track or collect information
            outside your web browser.</p>

        <h6>6.4 Managing and disabling cookies</h6>
        <p>We make available a cookie management platform on our portal (provided by
            <a href="https://www.onetrust.com/" target="_blank">OneTrust</a>), through which you can turn off non-essential
            cookies at any time. Please note, strictly necessary cookies will always be set as they are essential for our
            website to operate.</p>
        <p>You can change your cookie preferences or withdraw consent by clicking on the following button:</p>

        <h5 id="third-parties">7. Sharing your personal information with other persons</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><p>We share your personal information with our <strong>employees</strong>, to the extent this is necessary
                for them to perform their tasks, and with members of our group of companies, for the purposes set out in
                this Notice.</p></li>
            <li><p>We also share some limited information with third party <strong>service providers</strong> (as explained
                below) – these are companies that help us provide the portal to you, and they also help us to do all the
                actions that we describe in this Notice. When we trust our service providers with your information, we
                require them to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do
                not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit
                them to process your personal information for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions. We
                use the following types of service providers:</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h6>IT, email and web service providers</h6>
        <p>We share your personal information with our IT, email and web service providers, in order to enable them to
            provide us with their services. For example, we share your name and email address details with DotDigital, a
            service provider used for the purposes of sending emails to our users (such as  newsletters, collecting
            feedback, or any important service related emails). This data sharing enables us to send you emails, view when
            they are opened and view which links are clicked.</p>

        <h6>Surveys, support and feedback providers</h6>
        <p><strong>Freshdesk</strong> is our third party customer support tool that enables customers to contact us through
            a ticketing system on the website.</p>
        <p>For more information on Freshdesk’s Privacy Notice, visit
            <a href="https://www.freshworks.com/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.freshworks.com/privacy/</a>.</p>

            <a href="https://freshdesk.com/gdpr" target="_blank">https://freshdesk.com/gdpr</a>.</p>
        <p>We will occasionally ask for feedback on our portal. We will usually do this via an email which will direct you
            to our survey provider, <strong>UsabilityHub</strong>. It will only record; time spent, country, device type,
            device platform, unless specifically asked within the questions themselves for example, the survey may ask your
            age. You can find out more about UsabilityHub
            <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>If our business or part of our business is sold to another company, typically customer information would
                be transferred to that company. However, that company would still need to comply with this Privacy Notice
                and treat personal information as described in this Privacy Notice.</p></li>
            <li><p>Where necessary, we share personal information with our <strong>business advisors</strong>, such as legal
                advisors, consultants, accountants or auditors, for the purposes outlined in this Notice.</p></li>
            <li><p>In the event of a legal dispute, a court order or a legitimate request from a <strong>law enforcement
                agency or other public authority</strong>, we will share your personal information with our legal advisors,
                courts or such public authority, as necessary.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h5 id="data-retention">8. How long will we keep your personal information?</h5>
        <p>We will only retain your personal information for as long as you have an active account, unless we need to retain
            this information for longer, after your account is deactivated, in order to protect our legal interests and
            establish, exercise or defend a legal claim. If you deactivate your account, we may anonymise your information
            and use it for a period of time in an anonymous format for research and other business purposes, such as
            business analytics.</p>
        <p>For users that have registered but whose accounts are inactive, we will delete your personal information after 3
            years of inactivity.</p>

        <hr>

        <h5 id="your-rights">9. Your rights</h5>
        <p>Under data protection laws, you have certain rights in relation to your personal information, which you can
            exercise free of charge. In summary, those include the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>request a copy of your personal information and to certain other extra information that this Privacy
                Notice is already designed to address;</p></li>
            <li><p>require us to correct any mistakes in your information which we hold;</p></li>
            <li><p>require the erasure of personal information concerning you in certain situations;</p></li>
            <li><p>receive the personal information concerning you which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly
                used and machine-readable format (e.g. in pdf or .csv format) and have the right to transmit those data to a
                third party in certain situations;</p></li>
            <li><p>object (say no) at any time to processing of personal information concerning you for direct marketing;</p></li>
            <li><p>object (say no) in certain other situations to our continued processing of your personal information;</p></li>
            <li><p>otherwise require us to only store but not use your personal information in certain circumstances;</p></li>
            <li><p>where you have given your permission for us to use your information, to change your mind at any time.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note these rights may be <strong>limited</strong>, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal
            personal data about another person or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep
            or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping. We will inform you of the relevant exemptions upon which we
            rely when responding to any request you make.</p>

            <li><p>let us know (if possible) the information to which your request relates.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>This Privacy Notice will tell you what information we collect about you, how we use it, who we share it with,
            how long we keep it and how you can ask us about it.</p>

            learning website. From now on in the Privacy Notice, we’ll just use the name “Ocado” to mean us. Our office
            is at Buildings 1 & 2 Trident Place, Hatfield Business Park, Mosquito Way, Hatfield, AL10 9UL, United

        <h5>2. Personal information we collect about you</h5>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Your name,</p></li>
            <li><p>Your password (this is encrypted which means we won’t be able to see the password you’ve chosen),</p></li>
            <li><p>Information about your performance and progress (for example, what levels you have completed and what
                levels you create),</p></li>
            <li><p>The code you’ve created on our website,</p></li>
            <li><p>Any messages you send us when you use the “Contact Us” form or email,</p></li>
            <li><p>The date your Code for Life account was created and the date you last logged in,</p></li>
            <li><p>The IP address (this is a unique number which identifies the device you’ve used to log on to the Code
                for Life site) and other information about that device,</p></li>
            <li><p>Information about how you use the site, such as which pages you’ve visited and how long you stayed on
                each page. (We will only do this where you have allowed cookies – see the “Cookies and similar
                technologies” section for more details),
            </p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you sign up as an <strong>independent student</strong> for our Code for Life website, then we will also

            <li><p>The marketing choices you have selected, if you are over 18 years of age and have signed up for our
                newsletter.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you are under 13 years old, you will need to ask a parent or guardian to register for you and we
            will collect personal information about them.</p>

        <hr>

        <h5>3. How we will use the information</h5>

        <p>The UK’s Data Protection rules say that we have to have a lawful reason to process your personal information
            (“lawful” meaning that the law allows us to use your information in that way).</p>
        <p>Below we’ve listed the lawful reasons which allow us to process your information for the Code of Life
            Website:</p>
        <p><strong>Contract:</strong> We have to collect some personal information about you so we can provide you with
            the services we offer on the Code for Life website. For example, we need your name and a password so you can
            create an account and access our website and learning materials. This means you can access the portal and
            learn how to code with the support of your teacher and classmates, or work on your own/with a guardian if
            you are an independent student.</p>
        <p><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> We collect personal information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Help us improve the website and the services we can offer to you,</p></li>
            <li><p>Help make sure that our portal is safe and secure and that users are following our
                <a href="{% url 'terms'%}">Terms of Use</a>. For example, we might need to use account information to
                block a user from Code for Life temporarily or permanently if they misuse the site (e.g. by giving other
                people access to their account),</p></li>
            <li><p>If you are over 13, we need your email address to inform you about updates or changes to our service:
                for example, to let you know about any changes to our Terms of Use, or about any work we are carrying
                out that might affect when you can log on to the site. Sometimes, we may be required by law to send you
                this information,</p></li>
            <li><p>We will need to use your personal information to answer any questions you’ve asked using the ‘Contact
                Us’ form. Messages you send and receive through the site and any forms you send to us will be recorded.
                The Contact Us form is strictly for the purpose of user support. User-initiated communication concerning
                topics other than those relating directly to the Code for Life portal, including resources or user
                experience, may not be answered. Please be aware that we will never ask for personal information other
                than what is required to identify your account and respond to your queries, and we will never ask for
                your password,</p></li>
            <li><p>If you or your parent and guardian should make a legal claim against us, we may need to process your
                personal information to help defend ourselves against that claim.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h5>4. Change of purpose</h5>

        <p>We will only use your personal information for the reasons we collected it or for other similar reasons. If
            we need to use your personal information for a different reason, we will tell you. We do not always need
            your consent to use your personal information, and we will not ask for your consent unless the law says we
            need it.</p>

        <hr>

        <h5>5. Cookies & Similar technologies</h5>

        <p>When you visit our website, it will leave small data files called Cookies (not the edible kind) on your
            computer. Some of these are needed for the site to work (e.g. to help to keep it secure). Others are there
            to remember your settings (like how you’ve set up the sound) for when you next visit. We also use cookies
            that collect information about how you use our website (e.g. what pages you visit and how long you spend on
            the site). This is so we can see which parts of our site are popular and which we can improve in future.</p>
        <p>Please see the “What are cookies” (not the edible kind!) section below for more information on what
            information we collect and how we use cookies.</p>

        <h6>What are cookies?</h6>

        <p>Cookies are tiny files that have information (data) in them. When you visit our site, we may put some cookies
            on the device you use. Cookies allow us to remember things like when you visit our site. They help us
            understand how you are using the Code for Life portal, as well as which parts of our portal are popular and
            which ones we need to make better.</p>
        <p>We also make use of things called “web beacons” or “pixels.” These are similar to cookies and allow us to
            keep an eye on how well our website is working and look for ways to improve it. To keep things simple, when
            we talk about cookies in this Privacy Notice, we also mean web beacons and pixels.</p>

        <h6>Third party cookies</h6>

        <p>We work with other companies to run the analytics cookies on our portal, including Google, who provides our
            Google Analytics cookie, and Mouseflow. They might also collect information from websites that are not ours.
            We explain in more detail below what information they collect and how it is used. We do not let other
            companies show ads on our portal.</p>
        <p><strong>Google Analytics</strong>. We use Google Analytics (which is run by Google) to help us understand how
            you use our site. The information it collects about your use of the website (including your IP address) will
            be stored by Google in the United States. Google may pass this information to other organisations who help
            them to interpret this information. They may also pass the information to other organisations if the law
            says they have to do so. If you choose to allow analytics / performance cookies on our site, you are
            consenting to Google using your data for the reasons above.</p>
        <p><strong>Mouseflow</strong>. We also use Mouseflow to help us understand how our site is used and which areas
            are mostly used. It uses cookies to record information such as when you click on or move your mouse, when
            you scroll or press a key, what pages you visit on our website, how much time you spend on each page, and
            also information about the device you use (like the device type (desktop/tablet/phone), location
            (city/country) and language). Mouseflow does not collect any information on pages where it is not installed
            and does not track or collect information outside your web browser.</p>

        <h6>Managing and disabling cookies</h6>

        <p>You can switch the functional and analytics cookies on and off at any time by clicking this button below.</p>

        <h5>6. Who might we share your personal information with?</h5>

        <p>Your personal information will be shared with the Code for Life Team in Ocado, so they can set up and run
            your account.</p>
        <p>We may also share a small amount of information with organisations that provide email services to help us run
            the Code for Life website.</p>
        <p>For example, we share your name and email address details with DotDigital, a company that sends emails to
            users on our behalf (such as when we want to collect your feedback or need to give you important email
            updates about our service). This data sharing also allows us to view when your emails have been opened.</p>
        <p>Another company we share personal data with is Freshdesk. They help us keep track of the questions users send
            using the Contact Us form, so we can reply to them more quickly.</p>
        <p>We also use a survey company called UsabilityHub to help us carry out surveys. UsabilityHub records time spent
             on the site, country, device type, device platform alongside any questions that we may ask you in our
             surveys (for example, the survey may ask your age). You can find out more about UsabilityHub
            <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>We’ll only share your personal information with organisations mentioned in this Privacy Notice. They all sign
            an agreement to say that they will keep your personal information as safe and secure as we do, and that they
            will strictly follow our instructions on how your data can be used.</p>
        <p>Finally, we may need to share your information for legal reasons, such as if we sold our business to another
            company, if our business advisors needed the information to help us achieve the purposes in this Privacy
            Notice, or to respond to law enforcement or court requests if there is a legal problem.</p>

        <hr>

        <h5>7. How long will we keep your personal data?</h5>

        <p>We’ll only retain your personal information for as long as you have an active account on Code for Life,
            unless we need to keep it for longer than this to help us defend a legal claim.</p>
        <p>Once you deactivate your account, we might keep an anonymous version of your information to help us with
            research and other business reasons like assessing how the business is performing and planning for the
            future.</p>
        <p>For users that have registered but whose accounts are inactive, we’ll delete your personal information after
            3 years of inactivity.</p>
