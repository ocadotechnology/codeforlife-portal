            <h2>Introduction</h2>
        </section>
        <p>Ocado Technology, the division that powers Ocado.com, the world&rsquo;s largest online-only grocery retailer, has launched Code for Life.
            Code for Life is a nationwide corporate social responsibility initiative to help support primary school teachers deliver the new computer science curriculum.
            The aim of the initiative is to equip every child in the country with the “coding survival skills” that will enable them to flourish in an increasingly digital
            world.</p>
        <p>Ocado Technology is committed to protecting any data that we collect concerning you. By using our services you agree to the use of the data
            that we collect in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Ocado Technology is committed to providing a valuable source of supporting materials for teachers to
            deliver the current primary school curriculum, as well as a fun, educational web application from which students can learn. This Agreement is a legal document
            which sets out your rights and obligations, and those of Ocado Innovation Limited, a company registered in England under registration number 8813912
            (“Ocado Technology”, “we” or “us”), in relation to this site and the games and other products and services ofered by Ocado Technology through it
            (collectively, “Code for Life”).</p>

            <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
        </section>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> If you are under 13 years of age you must have your parent, guardian or carer&rsquo;s consent to register for a Code for Life
            account, and to use their email address. If you are using this at school, you must first have your teacher&rsquo;s permission to use this site.</p>
        <p>Code for Life includes all versions of “Rapid Router”, and any other online platforms released by Ocado Technology from time to time, including
            all Code for Life websites used to play the games that we make available. Rapid Router and its logo are trademarks of Ocado Technology. You must take the time to
            read and understand this Agreement before registering for Code for Life. By registering, you accept that you are entering into a contract with us on the terms of
            this Agreement. Visitors to the Code for Life portal who do not register to become a User similarly affirm that they are bound by this Agreement each time
            they access the Code for Life site.</p>
        <p>You should be aware that this Agreement may change from time to time.</p>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> You must ensure that the email address we hold for you is kept up-to-date and that you have full access to it.
            Important notifications are sent to the email address you&rsquo;ve provided. Failure to keep this information updated can result in your account being
            deleted.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="background">
        <h3>Registration and Types of Membership</h3>
        <p><strong>Membership falls into the following categories under the Agreement outlined in this policy:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Administrators: person or persons assigned responsibility for the management and security of membership by other Users;</p></li>
            <li><p>Users: any person using the Code for Life site or Rapid Router application regardless of membership;</p></li>
            <li><p>Students: Users who are provided with login information for Code for Life by your teacher, parent, guardian or carer;</p></li>
            <li><p>Teachers;</p></li>
            <li><p>Guardian, parents, carers;</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Many features of Code for Life require you to register as a User. Certain resources will be restricted to non-registered Users and Users
            who are not part of a participating school. Parents, guardians or carers of students registered through their school or club, should contact the child’s
            teacher directly to request copies of the teaching resources, to assist with homework or progression in learning how to program. Teachers should provide
            a valid and professional email address when registering on the Code for Life site.</p>
        <p>If you register a school or club, you will automatically become the responsible &lsquo;Administrator&rsquo;. You should provide a valid and
            professional email address when registering as a teacher. If you create a school on the Code for Life site, you, by default become an &lsquo;Administrator&rsquo;
            for your school.</p>
        <p><strong>As an Administrator, you warrant that:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>you are responsible and accountable for ensuring the online safety of the school or club for whom you are acting and that only
                legitimate institutional addresses should be accepted at sign up;</p></li>
            <li><p>all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful;</p></li>
            <li><p>you will maintain the accuracy of such information;</p></li>
            <li><p>if you are accepting this Agreement on behalf of a school or club, you have the authority to bind that institution, company or
                legal entity to this Agreement.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a User, you further warrant that you will only grant access codes to teachers, staff members and students who are current employees or
            students known to your school or club. Upon termination of a teacher or other staff member&rsquo;s employment with you, you will ensure they assign over all
            existing classes and/or students to another teacher within your school or club. If at any time you become aware of a User who falsely claims to be affiliated
            with your school or club, you are obliged to notify the Code for Life team immediately.</p>
        <p>A Code for Life User must not choose a username or institution name that could potentially infringe anyone&rsquo;s rights, which is intended to
            confuse, or which is offensive, hurtful or otherwise inappropriate, as reasonably determined by us. We reserve the right to change a username if we think it
            offends this Agreement. Users who are provided with login information for Code for Life by your teacher, parent, guardian or carer, are “Students”. Students
            are divided between those who are registered by a teacher through a school or club, or set up as an independent student using a parent, guardian, or carer
            email address.</p>
        <p>Please note that we are not an internet service provider. All Users of Code for Life must have internet access and the necessary software
            for email and web usage.</p>
        <p>Code for Life&rsquo;s Privacy Policy forms part of this Agreement, and your acceptance of this agreement constitutes consent to the way we may
            handle your personal data as detailed in that policy.</p>

            indicates the type of processes that may result in data being collected about you. Your use of this portal and our services gives us the right to collect

        <h3>Information collected by Ocado Technology, Code for Life, and its Use</h3>
        <p>The email address and full name collected at time of registration is used to identify a particular user in our system. This identifier
            gives teachers access to course material, class and individual student management features, and customer support, while giving students access to the web
            app in order to learn how to code within a supported environment (classroom), or independently (at home). We use the email address to notify the user of
            their registration status and login information, as well as updates to our privacy practices, our app and portal features, upcoming events and maintenance
            impacting User or Student accounts and for such other purposes as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>Messages may be sent periodically to a user profile with these communications and to offer support. Users can also use the Contact Us form
            to contact Ocado Technology staff directly for customer support. If you use the Contact Us form on the Code for Life portal and decide to disclose personally
            identifiable information this information can be stored by Ocado Technology. Ocado Technology staff will never ask for personal information other than what
            is required to locate a user in our system. Ocado Technology will never disclose user&rsquo;s personal information to a third party organisation. We strongly
            encourage users not to disclose personal information (other than name, email address and contact phone number where applicable) through any communication to

        <p>Your Internet browser has the in-built facility for storing small files or ‘cookies’ that hold information such as your IP address or the
            web browser being used, which allows a website to recognize your account. Our website employs this facility to enhance your experience and help us improve
            the effectiveness of our site. You have the ability to adjust your settings to prevent your computer from accepting cookies although this will reduce certain
            functionality on the website.</p>

    <div class="background">

            ensure users are following the site&rsquo;s Terms of Use. We may also use an email address and username to limit a user temporarily or permanently from the
            Code for Life portal if that user engages in inappropriate use of the site (e.g. giving other people access to their user account, malicious misuse of the
            portal, including spam).</p>

            required by applicable law. We also may disclose this information in response to a law enforcement agency&rsquo;s or other pertinent agency&rsquo;s request
            if we feel that such disclosure may prevent a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public or individual safety of someone using our site, protect
