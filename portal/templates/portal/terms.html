  <p><strong>Important:</strong> You must ensure that the email address we hold for you is kept up-to-date and that you have full access to it. Important notifications are sent to the email address you’ve provided. Failure to keep this information updated can result in your account being deleted.</p>
  <h2>Registration and Types of Membership</h2>
  <p>Membership falls into the following categories under the Agreement outlined in this policy:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Administrators: person or persons assigned responsibility for the management and security of membership by other Users;</li>
    <li>Users: any person using the Code for Life site or Rapid Router application regardless of membership;</li>
    <li>Students: Users who are provided with login information for Code for Life by your teacher, parent, guardian or carer;</li>
    <li>Teachers;</li>
    <li>Guardian, parents, carers.</li>
  </ul><br/>
  <p>Many features of Code for Life require you to register as a User. Certain resources will be restricted to non-registered Users and Users who are not part of a participating school. Parents, guardians or carers of students registered through their school or club, should contact the child’s teacher directly to request copies of the teaching resources, to assist with homework or progression in learning how to program. Teachers should provide a valid and professional email address when registering on the Code for Life site.</p>
  <p>If you register a school or club, you will automatically become the responsible ‘Administrator’. You should provide a valid and professional email address when registering as a teacher. If you create a school on the Code for Life site, you, by default become an ‘Administrator‘ for your school.</p>
  <br/><br/>
  <p>As an Administrator, you warrant that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>you are responsible and accountable for ensuring the online safety of the school or club for whom you are acting and that only legitimate institutional addresses should be accepted at sign up;</li>
    <li>all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful;</li>
    <li>you will maintain the accuracy of such information;</li>
    <li>if you are accepting this Agreement on behalf of a school or club, you have the authority to bind that institution, company or legal entity to this Agreement.</li>
  </ul><br/>
  <p>As a User, you further warrant that you will only grant access codes to teachers, staff members and students who are current employees or students known to your school or club. Upon termination of a teacher or other staff member's employment with you, you will ensure they assign over all existing classes and/or students to another teacher within your school or club. If at any time you become aware of a User who falsely claims to be affiliated with your school or club, you are obliged to notify the Code for Life team immediately.</p>
  <p>A Code for Life User must not choose a username or institution name that could potentially infringe anyone's rights, which is intended to confuse, or which is offensive, hurtful or otherwise inappropriate, as reasonably determined by us. We reserve the right to change a username if we think it offends this Agreement.</p>
  <p>Users who are provided with login information for Code for Life by your teacher, parent, guardian or carer, are "Students". Students are divided between those who are registered by a teacher through a school or club, or set up as an independent student using a parent, guardian, or carer email address. </p>
  <p>Please note that we are not an internet service provider. All Users of Code for Life must have internet access and the necessary software for email and web usage.</p>
  <p>Code for Life’s Privacy Policy forms part of this Agreement, and your acceptance of this agreement constitutes consent to the way we may handle your personal data as detailed in that policy.</p>
