<h2>
Ocado Technology
</h2>
<p> 
On the surface, Ocado.com is the world&#8217;s largest online-only grocery retailer. Customers use
our award winning mobile applications and website to place their orders, which are packed in our
world&#8211;class automated warehouses, and delivered in one hour time slots.
</p>
<p>
Look under the surface however, and you&#8217;ll unearth a dynamic technology company that has the
look, feel and culture of an innovative software start-up - Ocado Technology. That&#8217;s because
we develop all the software that powers Ocado in-house.
</p>
<p>
We have developed the Code for Life initiative to help support primary school teachers deliver the
new computer science curriculum with the aim of equipping every child in the country with the
“coding survival skills” that will enable them to flourish in an increasingly digital world.
</p>
<h3>
The Volunteers
</h3>
<p>
The Code for Life site and Rapid Router app would not have been possible without the time and skills
volunteered by our talented developers and creatives.
