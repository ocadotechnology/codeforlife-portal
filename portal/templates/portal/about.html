                <h5>What is Code for Life?</h5>
                <p>Code for Life (CFL) is a free, easy-to-use resource that provides teaching and lesson plans, user
                    guides and engagement through our two fun coding games: Rapid Router and Kurono. These games are
                    specially designed for people learning computing for the first time.</p>
                <p>The aim is to teach new coders the basic principles, to help them thrive in an increasingly digital
                    world. CFL is primarily designed for and tested by primary school teachers. Our games are aligned
                    with the UK's computing curriculum, so teachers can incorporate CFL into their lessons.</p>
                <p>Anyone looking to get into coding can also do so using the games and resources. We opened CFL
                    resources to parents and the general public during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic so that people
                    don't need to be part of a school to have access.</p>

                        “We were delighted computing entered the UK curriculum in 2014. However, many teachers felt
                        unprepared. And the lack of diversity in people studying STEM concerned us. So, we sought to
                        make the subject appeal to a broader group of both students and teachers."

            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <p>With that in mind, CFL was developed by volunteers and interns from Ocado Technology - the
                technology arm of Ocado Group - and teacher Sharon Harrison, who created the Rapid Router learning
                materials. Anne Marie continues:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="says text--brand-primary">
                        “I'm proud this initiative has been breaking down stereotypes. Children are seeing that you
                        don't have to fit a certain gender, race or personality type to get coding."
