    <h5 id="commitment">1. Our commitment</h5>
    <p>We are deeply committed to creating a safe and secure online learning environment for all students, teachers,
        parents and guardians who use the Code for Life portal.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>We strive to give you control over the personal information that you give us, and we take the protection
            of your information very seriously.</p></li>
        <li><p>We take extra precautions for the safety and privacy of our younger learners. Where personal information
            could be entered, for example when a student names a level, the teacher is notified via email and the
            teacher has the ability to delete the level if its name is rude or compromising.</p></li>
        <li><p>Our portal only relates to Code for Life and we do not show advertisements on our website or within our
            lessons.</p></li>

    <h5 id="information-use">4. How we will use information about you</h5>
    <p>We need all the categories of information that we describe above, so that we can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>perform our agreement with you and provide you with our services. For example, to enable you to create an
            account and to access the portal and our learning materials. Having an account gives teachers access to
            course material, class and individual student management features, and also it gives students access to the
            portal in order to learn how to code within a supported environment (classroom), or independently (at home).</p></li>
        <li>fulfil our legitimate interests, such as our interests to:
            <ul>
                <li><p>improve our services.</p></li>
                <li><p>ensure that our portal is secure and is used in accordance with our Terms. For example, we may
                    use account information to limit a user temporarily or permanently from the Code for Life portal if
                    that user engages in inappropriate use of the site (e.g. giving other people access to their user
                    account, malicious misuse of the portal, including spam).</p></li>
                <li><p>send you important information: for example, we use your email address to send you account
                    verification emails, emails to notify you about changes to our Terms, or about any maintenance
                    impacting your access to the portal. Sometimes, we may be required by law to send you this
                    information.</p></li>
                <li><p>provide customer support and respond to your queries, for example, when you use the Contact Us
                    form. We strongly advise you not to disclose personal information (other than name and email
                    address) when contacting us – messages you exchange on the portal and any forms you submit to us
                    will be recorded. The Contact Us form is strictly for the purpose of user support. User-initiated
                    communication concerning topics other than those relating directly to the Code for Life portal,
                    including resources or user experience, may not be answered. Please be aware that we will never ask
                    for personal information other than what is required to identify your account and respond to your
                    queries, and we will never ask for your password.</p></li>
                <li><p>protect our legal rights, for example, if we need to defend ourselves in court.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>with your permission (or if you are under 13, the permission of the person who looks after you) to send
            you marketing communications (for example, our newsletter or communications about our portal features or
            upcoming events). You have the right to change your mind at any time (see the “Your Rights” section below
            for more information).</p></li>
        <li><p>with your permission (or if you are under 13, the permission of the person who looks after you), use
            cookies to collect information about how you use our portal, in order to analyse and improve user
            experience. This information is usually anonymised and used at an aggregate level. Please see section
            “Cookies” below for more information on what information we collect and how we use cookies.</p></li>

    <h6>6.1 What are Cookies?</h6>
    <p>Cookies are tiny files that have information (data) in them. When you visit our portal, a cookie is placed on

        and how it is used.</p>
    <p><strong>Google Analytics</strong>. Our portal uses Google Analytics, which is provided by Google, Inc.
        ("Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyse how users use our portal. The information generated
        by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by
        Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use
        of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services
        relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties
        where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google
        will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. By accepting analytics / performance
        cookies on our portal, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the
        purposes set out above.</p>
    <p><strong>Mouseflow</strong>. We also use Mouseflow on our portal; this provider offers a website analytics tool
        that helps us understand how our portal is used, and which areas are mostly used (e.g. by using heatmaps or by
        replaying your journey on our portal). Mouseflow uses cookies to record information such as when you click on or
        move your mouse, when you scroll, or press a key, what pages you visit on our website, how much time you spend
        on each page, and also information about the device you use (operating system, device type

    <p>We make available a cookie management platform on our portal (provided by

    <h5 id="third-parties">7. Sharing your personal information with other persons</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><p>We share your personal information with our <strong>employees</strong>, to the extent this is necessary
            for them to perform their tasks, and with members of our group of companies, for the purposes set out in
            this Policy.</p></li>
        <li><p>We also share some limited information with third party <strong>service providers</strong> (as explained
            below) – these are companies that help us provide the portal to you, and they also help us to do all the
            actions that we describe in this Policy. When we trust our service providers with your information, we
            require them to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do
            not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit
            them to process your personal information for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions. We
            use the following types of service providers:</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h6>IT, email and web service providers</h6>
    <p>We share your personal information with our IT, email and web service providers, in order to enable them to
        provide us with their services. For example, we share your name and email address details with DotDigital, a
        service provider used for the purposes of sending emails to our users (such as  newsletters, collecting
        feedback, or any important service related emails). This data sharing enables us to send you emails, view when
        they are opened and view which links are clicked.</p>

    <h6>Surveys, support and feedback providers</h6>
    <p><strong>Freshdesk</strong> is our third party customer support tool that enables customers to contact us through
        a ticketing system on the website.</p>
    <p>For more information on Freshdesk’s Privacy Notice, visit
        <a href="https://www.freshworks.com/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.freshworks.com/privacy/</a>.</p>
    <p>For more information on Freshdesk and GDPR, visit
        <a href="https://freshdesk.com/gdpr" target="_blank">https://freshdesk.com/gdpr</a>.</p>
    <p>We will occasionally ask for feedback on our portal. We will usually do this via an email which will direct you
        to our survey provider, <strong>UsabilityHub</strong>. It will only record; time spent, country, device type,
        device platform, unless specifically asked within the questions themselves for example, the survey may ask your
        age. You can find out more about UsabilityHub
        <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><p>If our business or part of our business is sold to another company, typically customer information would
            be transferred to that company. However, that company would still need to comply with this Privacy Policy
            and treat personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p></li>
        <li><p>Where necessary, we share personal information with our <strong>business advisors</strong>, such as legal
            advisors, consultants, accountants or auditors, for the purposes outlined in this Policy.</p></li>
        <li><p>In the event of a legal dispute, a court order or a legitimate request from a <strong>law enforcement
            agency or other public authority</strong>, we will share your personal information with our legal advisors,
            courts or such public authority, as necessary.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h5 id="data-retention">8. How long will we keep your personal information?</h5>
    <p>We will only retain your personal information for as long as you have an active account, unless we need to retain
        this information for longer, after your account is deactivated, in order to protect our legal interests and
        establish, exercise or defend a legal claim. If you deactivate your account, we may anonymise your information
        and use it for a period of time in an anonymous format for research and other business purposes, such as
        business analytics.</p>
    <p>For users that have registered but whose accounts are inactive, we will delete your personal information after 3
        years of inactivity.</p>

    <hr>

    <h5 id="your-rights">9. Your rights</h5>
    <p>Under data protection laws, you have certain rights in relation to your personal information, which you can
        exercise free of charge. In summary, those include the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>request a copy of your personal information and to certain other extra information that this Privacy
            Policy is already designed to address;</p></li>
        <li><p>require us to correct any mistakes in your information which we hold;</p></li>
        <li><p>require the erasure of personal information concerning you in certain situations;</p></li>
        <li><p>receive the personal information concerning you which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly
            used and machine-readable format (e.g. in pdf or .csv format) and have the right to transmit those data to a

    </ul>
    <p>Please note these rights may be <strong>limited</strong>, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal
        personal data about another person or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep
        or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping. We will inform you of the relevant exemptions upon which we
        rely when responding to any request you make.</p>
