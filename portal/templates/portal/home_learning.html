            <p>Rapid Router is our shopping delivery game that makes it easy for children aged 5–14 to learn
                how to code using Blockly and Python.</p>
            <p>The game and lessons support the English National Curriculum Computing strand, and Teachers across
                the world love them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <p>We’ve made lessons available for parents and caregivers to teach at home, so we can
                #KeepKidsCoding. If you're a curious independent student this will also be perfect for you.
                The lessons are free and easy, but most of all, they’re fun!
            </p>
            <p>To begin, you can read our learning guide and start at Level 1.
                We encourage you to first register as an independent student to ensure the level progress is saved.

                        <div>Teach your child about problem-solving and logical reasoning as they play. They’ll explore
                            algorithms, and learn how to create and debug simple programs. Designed for children aged 5–7,
                            but start here if you’ve never played Rapid Router.

            <h5>Levels 1–16 </h5>
            <h6>Session 1</h6>
            <p>Print off the worksheets, and cut them out to play offline. This helps children see that they need to
                give the computer clear instructions so it can understand how to move the van.</p>
            <h6>Session 2</h6>
            <p>Explore Rapid Router online and learn how to play. Print the left-right van on page 6, to help avoid
                any confusion between left and right. Once a child has understood the basics, they can work on
                levels 1 to 5.</p>
            <h6>Session 3</h6>
            <p>Plan longer routes with more turns to learn how to create more complex algorithms. The direct drive
                buttons make things a little easier for younger children, or those with learning difficulties while
                they build confidence.</p>
            <h6>Session 4 & 5</h6>
            <p>Print off worksheets focusing on efficient routes and planning using levels 13 and 14. Levels 15–16
                include routes where there is more than one delivery to make and some complex and tangled
                routes.</p>

            <h5>Level 17-28</h5>
            <h6>Session 1</h6>
            <p>Start delivering shopping to lots of different places. It can be easier to plan routes on the paper
                worksheets before trying on a computer.</p>
            <h6>Session 2</h6>
            <p>Print out the three lesson worksheets. Then, watch the video together to learn about repeat loops.
                Encourage your child to look for patterns in their code. If they spot a repeated pattern, they can
                use a repeat loop to make it shorter. Talk about repeated patterns away from the world of computers
                with poems and exercises.</p>
            <h6>Session 3</h6>
            <p>Get stuck in with more complex loops – even loops inside loops! The printable worksheets help your
                child plan their code before trying it in Rapid Router. Printable left-right vans can help overcome
                any confusions between left and right.</p>
            <h6>Sessions 4 & 5</h6>
            <p>Guide your child through creating their own routes in Rapid Router. Perhaps you can join in and try
                each other’s routes?</p>

                            programming constructs. Designed for children aged 8–11, but anyone can progress here if
                            ready.

            <h5>Level 29-109</h5>
            <h6>Session 1</h6>
            <p>Recap earlier levels before looking at repeat loops. Encourage your child to plan ahead on the
                printable worksheet before writing more complex programs. If they’re unsure about using loops, ask
                them to write the code without loops and then look for repeating patterns.</p>
            <h6>Session 2</h6>
            <p>A video and printable resources support this lesson, which builds your child’s understanding of loops
                with a new loop, repeat-until.</p>
            <h6>Session 3 & 4</h6>
            <p>Extra tasks for children who want a challenge! Watch the if...do video to learn about selection
                statements. Ask your child to explain how their finished program works!</p>
            <h6>Extended</h6>
            <p>Build on everything learned so far with traffic lights, limited blocks, procedures and brain teasers.
                Older children might even like to start learning to program using the Python language using levels
                80 onwards.</p>
