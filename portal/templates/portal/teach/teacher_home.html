      Welcome to your Code for Life dashboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything you need to get you and your class programming is here. Anyone can learn how to code. Rapid Router will help you learn how. It&#8217;s fun, free and easy. Once you know how, you can build just about anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let&#8217;s get you started.
    </p>
    <h3>
      First steps
    </h3>
    <p>
      Having created your login, you now need to join the school or club to which you belong. If you&#8217;ve not joined yet, you can do that now. From here you&#8217;ll be able to create and manage all your classes, add or remove students and monitor and track every student&#8217;s progress.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Students
    </h3>
    <p>
      Every student will have their own unique name, class access code and password, allowing them to track their progress as they work through each level of Rapid Router. You&#8217;ll be able to reset passwords and print reminder cards to help them remember these details. Students can login from home while continuing to track their in-class progress, or they can ask their parent or guardian to sign up to play Rapid Router just for fun.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Your Resources
    </h3>
    <p>
      Now that you&#8217;ve registered your school or club, set up your classes and added your students, you can download the teaching resources. The session plans contain step-by-step instructions to help deliver each lesson and understand key concepts. Together you can work through the unplugged activities using the pupil resources, and watch the video that shows students what they&#8217;ll learn, before playing the Rapid Router app. At the end of each key stage, the assessment sheets will help identify which students are doing well, and those that may need more support.  If you need support, please <a href="{% url 'contact' %}">contact us</a>.
    </p>


    <h3>
      Session Plans
    </h3>
    <p>
      The session plans are designed to support key deliverables of the curriculum for Key Stage 1 and Lower Key Stage 2:
    </p>
    <h3>
      Key Stage 1
    </h3>
    <p>
      Children aged from 5 to 7 years will learn the basics of programming by coding a delivery van to drive around simple routes. They will sequence instructions and use simple repetition commands in Rapid Router, which has been built on the visual programming language, Blockly.  At the end of the Key Stage 1, children  will create their own maps and environments for a friend, to program the van and deliver groceries.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Lower Key Stage 2
    </h3>
    <p>
      Those aged from 7 to 9 years, will develop their understanding of programming  principles by learning how to use repeat loops, if statements and respond to changes in variables in Rapid Router. The activities focus on driving a delivery van around increasingly complex routes involving twists, turns and traffic lights. At the end of Lower Key Stage 2, the children can demonstrate their programming skills by creating a routing challenge for friends. Here, children get the opportunity to design their own background and characters, and set up variables such as traffic lights to increase the level of complexity.

<h3>Character Summary</h3>
<p>
Now you&#8217;ve mastered the fundamental basics of programming, it&#8217;s time to get creative! You can replace the green urban landscape of the app for a city or a snowy day, and instead of finding the quickest route for the van to get to the house, you may want to help Phil find the shortest path into the woods.
</p>
<p>
Discover your favourite character, choose your environment and create your own routing adventure.

<div class="section group characters">
  <div class="col span_1_of_3a">
    <img src="{% static 'portal/img/kirsty_hi_res.png' %}" />
      <h4>Kirsty</h4><br>
     <p>Kirsty is a girl with big ambitions. Her biggest ambition is to take the crown, and rule the world! Kirsty is not impressed that she hasn&#8217;t been born into the royal family, so she is trying to train an army of frogs to take the crown by force.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col span_1_of_3a">
      <img src="{% static 'portal/img/nigel_hi_res.png' %}" />
          <h4>Nigel</h4><br>
         <p>Nigel is the tallest kid in his class, and he's growing taller by the day. Sometimes this makes him feel a bit out of place, but he doesn't mind too much as it allows him to keep an eye out for the playground monitor when Nigel and his friends are up to playful mischief at lunchtime.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col span_1_of_3a">
     <img src="{% static 'portal/img/dee_hi_res.png' %}" />
       <h4>Dee</h4><br>
         <p>Dee is a Mark II DeliviBot. She&#8217;s super friendly and her wire hair sparks when she laughs. Dee is strong enough to juggle elephants, which makes delivering groceries a doddle.</p>
  </div>

<div class="section group characters">
  <div class="col span_1_of_2">
      <img src="{% static 'portal/img/phil_hi_res.png' %}" />
      <h4>Phil</h4><br>
        <p>Phil is a Boarsnark, the scariest monster of all monsters. Phil, however, is different to most Boarsnarks because he&#8217;s very kind, and very gentle, so he&#8217;s just not that good at scaring people. While other young Boarsnarks are hiding out in the woods practicing their fearsome roars, Phil can be found munching beetles, and playing computer games.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col span_1_of_2">
    <img src="{% static 'portal/img/wes_hi_res.png' %}" />
    <h4>Wes</h4><br>
    <p>Wes is as cunning as a fox, which is weird, because he's actually a wolf. He graduated from the fabulous foxy school for the fantastically gifted, with almost perfect grades in Crafty. Wes would be a genius, if only he stayed at home and studied a bit more. He&#8217;s such a party animal.</p>
