                <p>Code for Life would not have been possible without the dedication of our volunteers.
                </p>
                <p>In 2014, computing was added to the UK curriculum, requiring schools to teach coding
                principles and programming foundations.

                <p>Recognising a need to support teachers and students in navigating the uncharted territory,
                Ocado Technology deployed an army of internal volunteers who worked after hours, fuelled by
                free pizzas and fizzy drinks.
                </p>
                <p>What came out of this, is what you see today, used by educators and learners from over 150
                countries. Our products are open-source and free forever.

                <p><b>The portal or website</b></p>
                <p>This is the gateway for users to get to know who we are and what we do.
                It hosts our web-based games and plenty of teaching resources.
                </p>

                <p><b>Rapid Router</b></p>
                <p>An introduction to coding that is aimed at Key Stages 1-3 (age 5 to 14).
                Built on Blockly, it's a visual programming language similar to Scratch.
                The levels start off with Blockly and gradually progress to Python. With 109 levels,
                Rapid Router is our flagship game with the biggest user base.
                </p>

                <p><b>Kurono</b></p>
                <p>A multiplayer game that is aimed at older students of Key Stages 3 and up,
                it is primarily for use in a class or a club setting. Students code in Python to
                move their avatar around in order to complete tasks. Parts of Kurono are still in development.
