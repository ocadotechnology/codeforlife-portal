The museum\u2019s valuable artefacts are scattered across the shelves, the floor, the whole spacetime continuum. It\u2019s going to take more than just a backpack to collect them all. You need to use the Kurono time machine to get them back \u2013 but before jumping in you need to learn how to use its navigation system. This challenge shows you how to move around the map so you don\u2019t run into problems in the future\u2026or past.",

The blue artefacts will need to be separated from the red ones, as they have opposing magnetic fields. Can you tell which one is what type?",

In this timeline there seems to be an amount of falsified objects that resemble the ones you\u2019re looking for, but aren\u2019t quite genuine. These will have no value in the museum. Your navigation system will be able to tell you whether an object is genuine or not, but it\u2019s up to you to decide which ones to bring back!",
