The museum’s valuable artefacts are scattered across the shelves, the floor, the whole spacetime continuum. It’s going to take more than just a backpack to collect them all. You need to use the Kurono time machine to get them back – but before jumping in you need to learn how to use its navigation system. This challenge shows you how to move around the map so you don’t run into problems in the future…or past.",

Some of the artefacts escaped the vortex and ended up all over the museum - if each of you picks ten of them up, you should be done in time to embark in your journey. But beware! The blue artefacts will need to be separated from the red ones, as they have opposing magnetic fields. Can you tell which one is what type?",

You recognise some cars parked here and there, old-fashioned roads and houses like the ones your history teacher told you about. On the bright side, you seem to be alone and safe to walk around... for now. A more recent timeline doesn’t make artefacts easier to find, though. Or at least not the right ones. In this timeline there seems to be an amount of falsified objects that resemble the ones you’re looking for, but aren’t quite genuine. These will have no value in the museum. Your navigation system will be able to tell you whether an object is genuine or not, but it’s up to you to decide which ones to bring back!",

It might be a good idea to use your navigation system to scan all around you before even trying!

The electronic containers and shelves seem slightly different, and when the AI interlocutor speaks, you don’t recognise the language. It looks like you’ve changed something in the past that affected events in your present! If you manage to extract the metadata from the recovered artefacts, you should be able to find out which timelines they were found in. You can input this text into the Kurono machine to get things back to normal.",
